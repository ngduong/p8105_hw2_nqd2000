Mr. Trash Wheel dataset has 344 observations (rows) of 14 variables. Key
dumpster- and time-specific (identifying) variables include `dumpster,
month, year, date`, and dumpster characteristic variables are
`weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles`, while the rest, such
as `plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
grocery_bags`, etc. show the amounts of each trash type in the
dumpsters. More specifically, for example, median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017 was 8 balls.

The 2017 preciptation dataset has 12 observations, and the 2018
precipitation dataset has 12 observations. Key variables for both
precipitation datasets include `month`, `year`, and `precip_total`
denoting total precipitation for each month. Total precipitation in 2018
(for the months with available data) was 70.33, while total
precipitation in 2017 was 32.93.
